Data set for LREC 2020 paper "I Feel Offended, Don't Be Abusive!"

The repository is structured as follows:

- dictionary-based_experiments/ : the folder contains the script to replicate the dictionary experiments reported in the paper (OffenseEval sub-task A and AbuseEval binary classification)
- keywords/ : the folder contains the list of the top 50 keywords from the OffenseEval training and test data for sub-task A per class (list of keywords for offensive and not offensive messages)
